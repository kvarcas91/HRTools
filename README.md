## HRTools 
##### (personal project)
---


The aim of this App is to reduce the need of multiple different excel based trackers and have all the important employee information in one place.
It solves several issues:
- Information is accessible by everyone at the same time (data stored in SQLite)
- Information is 'shared' between different parts of application (i.e. if associate decides to resign, that input will notify meeting part to close 
meeting case if it exits)

##### Project contains:

- Meetings
  - When was scheduled
  - Owner
  - Outcome
- AWAL
- Sanctions
- Resignations
- LoA (Leave of Absence) - pending
- Feedbacks - pending
